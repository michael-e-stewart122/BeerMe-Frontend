# BeerMe!

[BeerMe URL](http://beer-me-react.herokuapp.com)

## Overview
* If you enjoy experiencing the local craft beer scene in your city as much as we do, this app is for you. BeerMe! allows you to search for brweries in your area and search the beers they have on tap. The user can also search by beer type. If you're an IPA enthusist like myself, you can search which breweries carry IPAs and go try them out on a summer afternoon. When you visit one of these breweries and enjoy the beer you ordered, take a pic of your beer, post it on your profile, and favorite the beer on our app for all your freinds and followers to see what you've been drinking. 

* BeerMe! was created with the Saturday afternoon beer lover in mind. Spending the weekend afternoons in a beer garden or touring a brewery is one of our favorite things to do with friends. The problem is finding new breweries to go to and finding the reviews of specific beers that brewery is serving. BeerMe! takes care of these problems. BeerMe! is also mobile friendly which was very important for us for on the go brewery searches/postings from your pocket.
